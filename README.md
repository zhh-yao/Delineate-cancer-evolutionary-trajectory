# Delineating cancer evolution from subclonal compositions

This is the full code for Manuscript "A novel multiscale framework for delineating cancer evolution from subclonal compositions"

`population_dynamics.py` is used to draw three growth patterns (i.e. aggressive, bounded, and indolent).


The file 'Figure_x' includes the codes involved in drawing different panels of Figure_x.

The file 'Figure_suppl_methods_results' includes the codes used to calculate outcomes involved in supplementary methods and supplementary results.
